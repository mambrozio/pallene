# Pallene Language Reference

Welcome to the Pallene reference manual.
This is a work in progress, so if you have any questions or suggestions, or if some point wasn't clear, please feel free to ask questions through a Github issue.

## A brief overview of Pallene

Pallene is a statically-typed companion language to Lua.
Pallene functions can be called from Lua and Pallene can call Lua functions as well.
At a first glance, Pallene code looks similar to Lua, but with type annotations.

Here is an example Pallene subroutine for summing the elements in an array of floating-point numbers.
Note that type annotations are required for function argument and return types but for local variable declarations Pallene can often infer the types.

```
function sum_floats(xs: {float}): float
    local r = 0.0
    for i = 1, #xs do
        r = r + xs[i]
    end
    return r
end
```

If we put this subroutine in a file named `sum.pln` and pass this file to the `pallenec` compiler, it will output a `sum.so` Lua extension module:

```
$ ./pallenec sum.pln
```

The `sum.so` file can be loaded from within Lua with `require`, as usual:

```
$ ./lua/src/lua
> sum = require "sum"
> print(sum.sum_floats({10.0, 20.0, 30.0})) --> 60.0
```

In this example, we invoke our bundled Lua interpreter because Pallene is only compatible with a specific release version of the interpreter.
The Lua installed in the system might be from an incompatible version.

## The Pallene Type System

Pallene's type system includes the usual Lua primitive types (`nil`, `boolean`, `float` and `integer`), as well as strings, arrays, tables, functions, and records.
There is also a catch-all type `any`, which can refer to any Lua or Pallene value.

### Primitive types

Pallene's primitive types are the same as Lua's:

- `nil`
- `boolean`
- `integer`
- `float`

There is no type `number`, since `integer` and `float` are separate types in Pallene.
Also, there is no automatic coercion between them.
For example, `local x: float = 0` is a type error; you should use `0.0` instead.

### Strings

Pallene also has a `string` type, for Lua strings.
The syntax for string literals is the same as in Lua.

Currently, the only supported operations for Pallene strings are concatenation with the `..` operator and printing strings to stdout with `io.write`.

### Arrays

Array types in Pallene are written `{ t }`, where `t` is any Pallene type. For example, `{ { integer } }` is the type for an array of arrays of integers.

Pallene arrays are implemented as Lua tables, and Pallene also uses the same syntax for array creation:

```
local xs: {integer} = {10, 20, 30}
```

Like Lua, reading from an "out of bounds" index produces `nil`, which results in a run-time type error unless the type of the array elements is `any`.
Notice that Pallene doesn't accept arrays of nil.

One important thing to know about array literals in Pallene is that they must be accompanied by a type annotation.
Pallene cannot infer their type otherwise because expressions like the empty list `{}` don't have an obvious best type.

```
-- This produces a compile-time error
-- "missing type hint for array or record initializer"
local xs = {1.0, 2.0, 3.0}
```

Nevertheless, Pallene is still able to infer then type of an array literal if they appear as an argument to a function, or in another position in the program that has a known expected type.

```
local result = sum_floats({1.0, 2.0, 3.0})
```

### Tables

Table types in Pallene are writen as `{ field: t [, field2: t2, ...] }`, where `field` is an identifier and `t` is any Pallene type.
For instance, `{ x: integer, y: integer }` is the type for a table with the fields `x` and `y` that are integers.

Like arrays, Pallene tables are implemented as Lua tables and Pallene uses the same Lua syntax for their creation:

```
typealias point = {x: integer, y: integer}
local p: point = {x = 10, y = 20}
```

Notice that all fields must be initialized in the Pallene initalizer list, even fields with the type `any` which could be `nil`.
Tables that come from Lua may have absent fields; like Lua, absent fields are considered to be nil.

It is possible to get and set fields in tables using the usual dot syntax:

```
p.x = 30
print(p.x) --> 30
```

In the current version of Pallene, the length of the field should be at max `LUAI_MAXSHORTLEN` characters.
In Lua 5.4, the default value for this constant is 40 characters.

### Functions

Function types in Pallene are created with the `->` type constructor.
For example, `(a, b) -> (c)` is the function type for a function that receives two arguments (the first of type `a` and the second of type `b`) and returns a single value of type `c`.
If the function receives a single input parameter, or returns a single value, the parenthesis can be omitted.
The following are more examples of valid function types:

```
int -> float
(int, int) -> float
(int, int) -> (float, float)
string -> ()
```

The arrow type constructor is right-associative.
That is, `a -> b -> c` means `a -> (b -> c)`.

A Pallene variable of function type may refer to either a statically-typed Pallene function or to a dynamically typed Lua function.
When calling a dynamically-typed Lua function from Pallene, Pallene will check whether the Lua function returned the correct types and number of arguments and it will raise a run-time error if it does not receive what it expected.

### Records

Record types in Pallene are nominal and should be declared in the top level.
The following example declares a record `Point` with fields `x` and `y` which are floats.

```
record Point
    x: float
    y: float
end
```

These points are created and used with a similar syntax to Lua:

```
local p: Point = {x = 10.0, y = 20.0}
local r2 = p.x * p.x + p.y * p.y
```

Pallene records are implemented as userdata, and are *not* Lua tables.
You cannot create a Lua table with an `x` and `y` field and pass it to a Pallene function expecting a Point.
The fields of a Pallene record can be directly accessed by Pallene functions using dot notation but are *cannot* be accessed by Lua functions the same way.
From the point of view of Lua, Pallene records are opaque.
If you want to allow Lua to read or write to a field, you shold export appropriate getter and setter functions.

### Any

Variables of type `any` can store any Lua or Pallene value.

```
local x: any = 10
x = "hello"
```

Similarly, arrays of `any` can store anys of varied types

```
local xs: {any} = {10, "hello", 3.14}
```

Upcasting a Pallene value to the `any` type always succeeds.
Pallene also allows you to downcast from `any` to other types.
This is checked at run-time, and may result in a run-time type error.

```
local v = (17 as any)
local s = (v as string)  -- run-time error: v is not a string
```

The `any` type allows for a limited form of dynamic typing.
The main difference compared to Lua is that Pallene does not allow you to perform any operations on a `any`.
You may pass a `any` to a functions and you may store it in an array but you cannot call it, index it, or use it in an arithmetic operation:

```
function f(x: any, y: any): any
    return x + y -- compile-time type error: Cannot add two anys
end
```

You must first downcast the `any` to the appropriate type.
Sometimes the Pallene compiler can do this automatically for you but in other situations you may need to use an explicit type annotation.
The reason for this is that, for performance, Pallene must know at compile-time what version of the arithmetic operator to use.

```
function f(x: any, y: any): integer
    return (x as integer) + (y as integer)
end
```

## Structure of a Pallene module

A Pallene module consists of a sequence of type declarations, module-local variables, and function definitions.

### Type aliases

Creates an alias for a previously-declared type with the following syntax:

```
typealias <name> = <type>
```

Type alias in Pallene currently cannot be used to declare recursive types, such as:

```
typealias T = {T}
```

### Record declarations

Record declarations consist solely of record declarations.

```
record <name>
    <name> : type
    ...
end
```

### Module-local variables

Module-local variables are declared with the following syntax:

```
local <name> [: type] {, <name> [: type]} = <exp> {, <exp>}
```

It is possible to declare multiple variables at once. The behaviour for expressions that are function calls is the same as in Lua.

### Functions

Functions are declared as follows:

```
[local] function <name>([<params>])[: <rettypes>]
    <body>
end
```

A `local` function is only visible inside the module it is defined.
Non-local functions are exported, which means that they are accessible to Lua if it requires the Pallene module.

As with variables, `<name>` can be any valid identifier, but it is a compile-time error to declare two functions with the same name, or a function with the same name as a module variable.
The return types `<rettypes>` are optional, and if not given it is assumed that the function does not return anything.
If two or more return types are present, a parenthesis surrounding them is required.

Parameters are a comma-separated list of `<name>: <type>`.
Two parameters cannot have the same name.
The function body is a sequence of statements.

Pallene functions can be recursive.
Blocks of mutually-recursive functions are also allowed, as long as the mutually-recursive functions are declared next to each other, without any type or variable declarations between them.

## Expressions and Statements

Pallene uses the same set of operators and control-flow statements as Lua.
The only difference is that the type system is more restrictive:

* The logic operators (`not`, `and`, `or`) only operate on expressions of type `boolean` or of type `any`
* The condition of `if`, `while` and `repeat` must be of type `boolean` or of type `any`
* Relational operators (`==`, `<`, etc) must receive two arguments of the same type.
* The arithmetic and concatenation operators don't automatically coerce between numbers and strings.

## Type annotations and type inference

Pallene is a statically-typed language, which means that every variable and expression has a known type, determined at compilation time.
Sometimes this may be the catch-all type `any`, but it is still known at compilation time.
Similarly to most other statically-typed languages, Pallene allows you to add type annotations to variables, functions, and expressions.
(This is one of the few syntactical differences between Lua and Pallene.)
Pallene type annotations for variables and functions are written using colons.
For expressions the colon is already used for method calls, so Pallene uses the `as` operator instead.

```
function foo(x : any) : integer
   local y: integer = (x as integer)
   return y + y
end
```

Unlike languages like C or Java, Pallene does not require type annotations on every variable.
It uses a bidirectional type-checking system that is able to infer the types of almost all variables and expressions.
Roughly speaking, you must include type annotations for the parameters and return types of top-level functions, and almost everything else can be inferred from that.
For example, notice how the `sum_floats` from the Brief Overview section does not include a type annotation for the `result` and `i` variables.

If a local variable declaration doesn't have an initializer, it must have a type annotation:
```
function contrived(): integer
    local x:integer
    x = 10
    return x
end
```

### Automatic type coercions

In some places in a Pallene program there is a natural "expected type".
For example, the type of a parameter being passed to a function is expected to be the type described by the corresponding function type.
Similarly, there is also an expected type for expressions surrounded by a type annotation, or values being assigned to a variable of known type.

If the expected type of an expression is `any` but the inferred type is something else, Pallene will automatically insert an upcast to `any`.
Similarly, if the inferred type is `any` but the expected type is something else, Pallene will insert a downcast from `any`.
For instance, one of the code examples from the Any section of this manual can be rewritten to use automatic coercions as follows:

```
local v: any  = 17
local s: string = v
```

In addition to allowing conversions to and from `any`, Pallene also makes implicit conversions to and from types that contain `any` in compatible ways.
For example, `{ any }` and `{ integer }` are considered to be compatible, and one may be used where the other is expected.
Similar, for function types `integer -> integer`, `any -> integer`, `integer -> any`, and `any -> any` are all compatible with each other.
These automatic coercions between array and function types never fail at run-time.

To illustrate this, consider the following function for inserting an element in a list.

```
function insert(xs: {any}, v:any)
    xs[#xs + 1] = v
end
```

Since the parameter to the insert function is an array of `any`, we can use it to add elements to lists of any type:

```
local ns: {integer} = {10, 20, 30}
insert(ns, 40)

local ss: {string} = {"hello"}
insert(ss, "world")
```

However, the insert function only guarantees that its first parameter is an array.
If the input is an homogeneous array, the insert function does not ensure that the value being inserted has the same type.
If a value of the "wrong" type is inserted, this will only be noticed when attempting to read from the array.

```
local ns: {integer} = {10, 20, 30}
insert(ns, "boom!")
local x1 : integer = ns[1]
local x2 : integer = ns[4] -- run-time error
```

## Exporting top-level components

The `export` keyword can be used to export top-level components such as variables and functions from a Pallene module.
The keyword `export` can be used in the same places where the `local` keyword can be used.
Every top-level component declaration should have either `local` or `export` modifier because Pallene does not support global variables.

In the following example, we export `foo` and `name` from our module.
```lua
export function foo(x: integer): integer
    return x + 1
end

export name: string = "Hello"
```

You can export on top-level components from a Pallene module.
Further, it is an error to export the same name twice.


When variables are exported from a module, only the initial values are exported.
Therefore, any changes made to the variable from within the module after the export, will not be reflected outside.
You could over come this limitation (or perhaps a feature), using tables.
For example, if the exported value is a table then the contents of the table may change and that will be seen outside.
But if you are exporting a string or number variable, any subsequent changes will remain unseen outside the module.

This is an intended behavior.
In fact, it is analogous to what happens if you define a Lua module like this:
```lua
local x = 10

local function f()
    return x
end

return { x = x, f = f }
```

In Lua you can also create modules in a way that lets the variables be monkey-patched.
```
local m = {}

m.x = 10

function m.f()
    return m.x
end

return m
```

But we do not use this pattern in Pallene because it is harder to optimize function calls if they can be monkey-patched.
